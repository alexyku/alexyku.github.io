        I'm a PhD student in Psychology and Neuroscience at Princeton, where I work with
        <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php">Tom Griffiths</a> and
        <a href="https://jdc.princeton.edu/">Jon Cohen</a>,
        and also a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind.
        Before this, I received my BA and MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley.
        <br><br>
        My research focuses on how adaptive systems
        — primarily artificial neural networks, but also human cognition —
        manage the tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency in response to complex and variable demands.
        A key part of this tradeoff lies in how these systems internally represent information: flexible representations support rapid, context-sensitive behavior, while more efficient representations promote stability and generalization.
        I investigate the costs of maintaining and processing flexible representations, the mechanisms through which these representations are gradually consolidated for efficiency, and how these processes are optimized across operational timescales.
