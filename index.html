        I'm a PhD student at Princeton University, where I'm advised by <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php">Tom Griffiths</a> and <a href="https://jdc.princeton.edu/">Jon Cohen</a>.
        I'm also a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.google/">Google DeepMind</a>.
        <!-- I received my bachelors and masters in computer science from UC Berkeley. -->

        <!-- I'm interested in understanding the computational and statistical basis for language processing and acquisition.
        In particular, how symbolic pathways for language emerge from neural systems.

        <!-- My research aims to understand how the statistics of a learner's curriculum shapes various aspects of their intelligence. -->
        <!-- In particular, as it pertains to language, abstraction, and symbolic processing. -->

        My research aims to quantify the degree to which the structure and statistics of language contributes to various aspects of human intelligence.
        Specifically, how they shape higher-order cognitive functions such as symbolic processing, abstract reasoning, and planning.
        Understanding this relationship is central to better understanding and improving AI systems, the most powerful of which are trained on language.

        Previously, I've worked on grounded language learning, text-to-image generation, and genomics.
