    I'm a software engineer at Google Research where I work on large multimodal deep learning models for vision and language.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research focusses on understanding the basis for abstract structures in minds and machines that enable them to generalize and solve challenging inductive tasks.
    <br>
    In particular I'm interested in the role natural language plays as the symbolic scaffolding for abstract structures to emerge.
    <br>
    As a result, my projects alternates between engineering large multimodal models, trained on Google-scale data, and analyzing them from a cognitive lens.

    I completed my bachelors and masters in computer science at UC Berkeley, where I was affiliated with the <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php">CoCoSci Lab</a> with Prof. Tom Griffiths and the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">RISELab</a> with Prof. Joey Gonzalez.
    <br>
    I'm currently in <a href="http://www.jasonbaldridge.com/">Jason Baldridge</a>'s grounded language understanding group at Google.
